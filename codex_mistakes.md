# Codex Mistakes Log

This file documents recurring mistakes or quirks that happen when using Codex/ChatGPT to generate code for this project (`workout_app`). It helps prevent repeated bugs — especially visual/UI errors that are easy to miss in code but obvious during app testing.

Every entry includes:
- **Context** – Where the issue appeared (e.g., screen, widget, function)
- **Mistake** – What Codex/ChatGPT did wrong
- **Problem** – What went wrong when the code was run
- **Fix** – How the issue was resolved
- **Lesson** – How to avoid it next time (prompting tips or implementation rules)

---

Add new entries below as issues are encountered. Over time this becomes a reference to improve prompting and code reviews when using Codex/ChatGPT.
